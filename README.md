# Maurice_Mano_CLI_AND_GUI_Assembler
Inspired by Maurice Mano, this project delivers a robust assembler tool with both CLI and GUI interfaces. It supports the conversion of assembly code to machine language and vice versa, while offering detailed logging of register operations. The use of the tabulate library ensures well-organized output, making this assembler an essential tool for those studying or working with computer architecture and assembly language.
